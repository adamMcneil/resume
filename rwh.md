Hello Rock Hill Woodworking Team,

I recently graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a Master’s degree in Computer Science.
Although my educational background does not directly align with this position, I have a genuine passion for woodworking.

I am a very hard-working person.
The University of Illinois is ranked among the top five schools in the world for computer science, and computer science is an extremely competitive program.
Admission is difficult, but so is the coursework.
I completed the Master’s program in just two semesters instead of the recommended three.
I also completed my bachelor’s degree in only three years instead of the usual four by taking heavier course loads, all while maintaining a high GPA.

My first experience with woodworking was building a kitchen island with my father in high school.
Later, I discovered the Blacktail Studio YouTube channel and instantly fell in love with woodworking.
I knew at the time that what he was doing looked really fun and rewarding.

Since then, I have done much more than just watch videos—I have taken every opportunity during school breaks to build things out of wood.
I have built tables, benches, end tables, bookshelves, and a kitchen island.
I have also installed, sanded, and finished hardwood floors for my family.
In addition, I repurposed extra wood flooring to create a dining table and benches.

I even have some experience milling my own lumber.
I have used a chainsaw and an Alaskan sawmill to mill logs from my family’s property, as well as a bandsaw mill.
I am comfortable using tools such as table saws, routers, planers, bandsaws, miter saws, and sanders.
I have also operated front loaders, excavators, and forklifts on our property.
In addition, I have gained some experience with framing and general carpentry through home renovation projects with my family.

I know much of what is on my resume does not directly relate to woodworking, but I am passionate about the craft and very excited to learn more.
I am not sure if my limited background in woodworking would qualify me as a good fit for this position.
However, I take pride in excelling at everything I do and have a strong ability to learn new skills quickly.

I genuinely see woodworking as a much better long-term career path for me than the traditional route taken by most computer science graduates.
While it may not be as lucrative, gaining hands-on skills and expertise in a craft like woodworking is far more valuable and meaningful.
There is great value in creating quality physical products that real people can use and enjoy.
I would love to talk more about the position and visit your shop in person.

Thanks,
Adam McNeil
